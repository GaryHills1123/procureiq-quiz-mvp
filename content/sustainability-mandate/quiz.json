  "scenario": "TechFlow Solutions, a mid-sized technology company, has just announced an ambitious sustainability goal: achieve 60% sustainable suppliers across all procurement categories within 18 months. This mandate comes from new board-level ESG commitments and regulatory compliance requirements (EU CSRD). As the procurement manager, you currently have only 25% sustainable suppliers and face budget constraints, tight timelines, and varying supplier capabilities. Your decisions will determine whether TechFlow meets its sustainability targets while maintaining operational efficiency and cost competitiveness.",
